The start of a basic regular expression library in C.

The main reason for the library's existence is providing a combination
of features that's hard to find elsewhere:

    - DFA-based
    - Capture groups
    - Streaming API
    - Parallel matching of multiple expressions

However, the code isn't in great shape and hasn't been exercised much
yet either. For now, maintainance remains limited to bugfixes.
